title: Functional Specification Document (FSD)
description: Project development template outline.
---

#### 1. **Document Information**
   - **Title**: Name of the web application (e.g., "Task Management Web App FSD").
   - **Version**: Version number of the document (e.g., v1.0).
   - **Author(s)**: Names and roles of contributors (e.g., product manager, lead developer).
   - **Date**: Creation or revision date (e.g., September 1, 2025).
   - **Approval**: List of stakeholders who must review/approve the document.
   - **Change History**: A table tracking document revisions, including version, date, and changes made.

---

#### 2. **Introduction**
   - **Purpose**: Brief explanation of the FSD’s goal (e.g., to define technical requirements for building the web app).
   - **Scope**: Overview of what the web app will do and its boundaries (e.g., "A task management app for teams to assign, track, and complete tasks, excluding invoicing features").
   - **Audience**: Who the document is for (e.g., developers, designers, QA team, stakeholders).
   - **Definitions and Acronyms**: Key terms (e.g., API, UI, UX) and project-specific jargon.

---

#### 3. **System Overview**
   - **App Description**: High-level summary of the web app’s purpose and value (e.g., "A cloud-based platform to streamline team task collaboration").
   - **Objectives**: Specific goals (e.g., improve team productivity, reduce task tracking errors).
   - **System Architecture**: Overview of the technical structure (e.g., frontend in React, backend in Node.js, MongoDB database).
   - **Key Features**: List of core functionalities (e.g., user authentication, task creation, notifications).

---

#### 4. **Functional Requirements**
   - **Feature Breakdown**: Detailed description of each feature, typically organized by module or user flow. For each feature:
     - **Feature Name**: (e.g., "User Authentication").
     - **Description**: What the feature does (e.g., "Allows users to register, log in, and reset passwords").
     - **Inputs**: Data or user actions required (e.g., email, password).
     - **Outputs**: Expected results (e.g., successful login redirects to dashboard).
     - **User Interface**: Description of UI elements (e.g., login form with email and password fields).
     - **Dependencies**: Other features or systems required (e.g., email service for password reset).
   - **User Roles and Permissions**: Define roles (e.g., admin, team member) and their access levels (e.g., admins can delete tasks, users cannot).
   - **Workflows**: Step-by-step user or system processes (e.g., "User submits task → System assigns task ID → Notification sent to assignee").

---

#### 5. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - **Performance**: Expected response times (e.g., page load under 2 seconds).
   - **Scalability**: Capacity to handle users (e.g., support 1,000 concurrent users).
   - **Security**: Measures like encryption, authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, HTTPS).
   - **Usability**: Accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 compliance).
   - **Reliability**: Uptime requirements (e.g., 99.9% availability).
   - **Compatibility**: Supported browsers/devices (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, mobile responsive).

---

#### 6. **Technical Specifications**
   - **Frontend**: Frameworks, libraries, or tools (e.g., React, Tailwind CSS).
   - **Backend**: Server-side tech (e.g., Node.js, Express, REST API).
   - **Database**: Structure and type (e.g., MongoDB with collections for users, tasks).
   - **APIs**: Internal/external APIs, including endpoints (e.g., POST /api/tasks for task creation).
   - **Hosting/Deployment**: Cloud provider or server setup (e.g., AWS, Docker).
   - **Data Models**: Schema descriptions (e.g., Task: {id, title, assignee, due_date}).

---

#### 7. **User Interface and Experience**
   - **Wireframes/Mockups**: Reference to attached or linked UI designs (e.g., Figma links).
   - **Navigation Flow**: How users move through the app (e.g., homepage → task list → task details).
   - **Error Handling**: How errors are displayed (e.g., "Invalid email" alert on login failure).

---

#### 8. **Assumptions and Constraints**
   - **Assumptions**: Conditions assumed to be true (e.g., users have stable internet).
   - **Constraints**: Limitations (e.g., budget, timeline, or tech stack restrictions).

---

#### 9. **Testing Requirements**
   - **Unit Testing**: Components to test (e.g., API endpoints, UI components).
   - **Integration Testing**: How systems interact (e.g., frontend-backend communication).
   - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Criteria for user approval (e.g., task creation works as expected).
   - **Tools**: Testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Cypress).

---

#### 10. **Implementation Plan**
   - **Timeline**: Milestones and deadlines (e.g., MVP completion by Q4 2025).
   - **Resources**: Team roles (e.g., 2 frontend developers, 1 backend developer).
   - **Risks**: Potential issues and mitigation (e.g., "API downtime risk: implement fallback").

---

#### 11. **Appendices**
   - **Glossary**: Additional terms or acronyms.
   - **References**: Related documents (e.g., PRD, wireframes).
   - **Diagrams**: System architecture, data flow, or ERD (entity-relationship diagram).
   - **Mockup Links**: External links to designs or prototypes.
